        "\n",
        "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced AI framework that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve factual accuracy and contextual relevance. Instead of relying purely on a pre-trained modelâ€™s memory, RAG dynamically retrieves relevant documents or knowledge from external sources before generating a response.\n",

        "3. **Fusion Mechanism â€“** Integrates retrieved knowledge with the model's generative capabilities."
