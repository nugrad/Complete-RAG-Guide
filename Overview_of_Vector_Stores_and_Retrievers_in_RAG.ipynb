        "A vector store (or vector database) is a specialized database designed to store and retrieve high-dimensional embeddings (vector representations of text, images, or other data). It allows for efficient similarity search to find the most relevant documents based on query embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "**🔹 How Vector Stores Work**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Text Embedding:** Convert text into dense vector representations using an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002, Sentence-BERT).\n",
        "* **Storage:** Store these vectors in a database along with metadata.\n",
        "* **Similarity Search:** When a query arrives, it is also converted into a vector, and the store retrieves the most similar vectors/documents using Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) search.\n",

        "\n",
        "  * Use traditional keyword-based search (e.g., TF-IDF, BM25 ranking).\n",
        "  * Often combined with vector search for hybrid retrieval.\n",
        "3. **Hybrid Retrievers**\n",
