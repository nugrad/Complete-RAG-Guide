It has been successfully used in various tasks such as reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment, and learning task-independent sentence representations.\n",

It involves adding sinusoidal functions of different frequencies to the input embeddings at the bottom of the encoder and decoder stacks. These positional encodings help the model learn to attend to tokens based on their relative positions in the sequence.\n",

The first sub-layer is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. The encoder also includes residual connections and layer normalization. The output of the encoder is a sequence of continuous representations.\n",

In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder includes a third sub-layer that performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. This allows the decoder to generate an output sequence based on the input sequence. The decoder also uses residual connections and layer normalization. The self-attention mechanism in the decoder is modified to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions, ensuring that predictions depend only on known outputs at positions less than the current position.\n",
